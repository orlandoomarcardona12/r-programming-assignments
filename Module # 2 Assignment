# the error said "Error in myMean(assignment2) : object 'assignment' not found" 
The reason it doesnt work is because the variable names in parts of the function are not called in the orginal parameters. The variable name "someData is never used in the parameters thus creating an error. 
The corrected version is:
assignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)
myMean <- function(assignment2) {
  return(sum(assignment2) / length(assignment2))
}
myMean(assignment2)
